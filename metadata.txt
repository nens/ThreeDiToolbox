about=Toolbox for working with hydraulic 3Di models.
    This includes tools for data validation, model creation and working with
    results. Use the QGIS 64-bit version on Windows. Although we aim to be as 
	backwards compatible as possible, it is possible that at some point old results 
	will not work with the newest version of the plugin. We expressly disclaim any 
	guarantee or warranty of compatibility between the two.
	For questions on 3Di or the use of this plugin please contact us via
