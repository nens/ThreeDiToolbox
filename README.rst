A QGIS plugin with tools for working with models and netCDF results from
`3Di`_ hydraulic/hydrologic modelling software.

.. _`3Di`: http://www.3di.nu/

The main features are:

- Visualization of model network structure and discretization
- Time series visualization
- Sideviews
- Visualize results spatially
- An extensible toolbox with custom Python scripts (for e.g. statistical analysis)
- Import of sufhyd files

Take a look at the `Wiki`_ for more information.

Installing requirements
-----------------------

- QGIS 3 (64 bit)
- pyqtgraph
- sqlalchemy version 1.1.0 or higher
- geoalchemy2 with custom modifications, source available here: https://github.com/nens/geoalchemy2
- h5py (included for Windows)

These Python dependencies are included in the **distribution** of the plugin,
but if you clone this repository you need to manually install them in the
``external`` directory::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt --target=external --no-deps -U

Windows
^^^^^^^

The package includes the dependencies 'netCDF4' and 'h5py' for 64 bit
installations of QGIS under Windows (tested on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 10).
If you are using the 32 bit version of QGIS, it is best to upgrade to the 64
bit version or build the python packages netCDF4 and h5py including C bindings
yourself. When building these packages, make sure to use the HDF5 version used
in Qgis (1.8.11)::

    $ python -m pip install --no-binary=h5py --no-deps --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-IC:\Program Files\QGIS 3.4\include" --global-option="-LC:\Program Files\QGIS 3.4\lib" h5py

Linux
^^^^^

For Linux, NetCDF and h5py dependencies are **not** included, so you have to
install them::

$ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev libnetcdf-dev

Install Python packages globally because we don't include them for Linux::

$ sudo pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -U

You might need to install the Qt4 PostgreSQL driver for loading sufhyd::

$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-sql-psql


Installation
------------

The plugin can be added using one of the following ways:

- Using the Lizard QGIS repository: via the QGIS menu bar go to
  Plugins > Manage And Install Plugins... > Settings; add ``https://plugins.lizard.net/plugins.xml`` and reload.
  Install the plugin by selecting ThreeDiToolbox.
- Copy or symlink the repo directory to your plugin directory (on Linux:
  ``~/.qgis2/python/plugins``, on Windows: ``C:\\Users\<username>\.qgis2\python\plugins\``); make sure to install
  external dependencies (see Requirements section).


Local development
-----------------

Local development happens with docker to make sure we're working in a nicely
isolated environment. So first build the docker::

  $ docker-compose build

If your user ID isn't ``1000``, you can run it like this::

  $ docker-compose build --build-arg uid=`id -u` --build-arg gid=`id -g`

The docker-qgis's settings are persisted in a "named docker volume",
``qgis-docker``. To wipe it clean, run ``docker-compose down -v``.

The tests that run on travis-ci.org cache the docker image that is being build
in order to shave 5 minutes off the test duration. The image is automatically
rebuild when the ``Dockerfile``, ``docker-compose.yml`` or one of the two
`requirements` files changes. It is also possible to empty travis' cache in
case something seems to be wrong.

To run the full tests including coverage report and flake8::

  $ docker-compose run qgis-desktop make test

You can also just run pytest. You won't get the coverage report. You *can*
however then use one of the pytest options, like ``-x``, which aborts the test
at the first failure::

  $ docker-compose run qgis-desktop pytest -x

To get a "coverage" report for the docstrings or to run flake8::

  $ docker-compose run qgis-desktop make docstrings
  $ docker-compose run qgis-desktop make flake8

(Note: flake8 is pyflakes + pycodestyle/pep8).


Release
-------

Make sure you have ``zest.releaser`` with ``qgispluginreleaser`` installed. To make a release (also
see: [1]_)::

    $ cd /path/to/the/plugin
    $ fullrelease  # NOTE: if it asks you if you want to check out the tag press 'y'.

Manually copy to server::

    $ scp ThreeDiToolbox.0.2.zip <user.name>@packages-server.example.local:/srv/packages.lizardsystem.nl/var/plugins


Tests
-----

Make sure test deps from ``requirements-dev.txt`` are installed. Run tests with::

    $ source scripts/run-env-linux.sh /usr  # this should be automated (e.g. using Makefile)
    $ make test


Notes
-----

.. [1] Under the hood it calls ``make zip`` which is modified a bit (see ``Makefile``, old zip directive
       is still avaiable) so that it doesn't copy everything to your QGIS plugin directory.
